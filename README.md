# brexitbracket
A fun little Python program on determining the winner of EU exit names based off of a meme map on the internet. 
The code will evolve over time as my skills as a programmer develop.
At this point, 2/6/2020:
The program asks you to fill out 16 slots of names from the map.
The program then asks which you prefer to win in a tournament style matchup that goes through the Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, a third place battle, and the finals.
